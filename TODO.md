# Rust Implementation Tasks

## High Priority
- [x] Fix compilation error: `error[E0753]: expected outer doc comment` in `rust/examples/../src/encoders/topk.rs:2` - change `//!` to `///` (COMPLETED)
- [x] Complete SIMD optimizations (fixed AVX2 compilation issues)
- [ ] Fix failing integration tests:
  - [ ] `test_edge_cases`: Fix assertion failure (expected 16, got 20) in rust/tests/integration_test.rs:70
  - [ ] `test_performance_characteristics`: Optimize performance for size 10000 operations
- [ ] Implement zero-copy operations for FFI performance
- [ ] Parallel encoding for batch operations  
- [ ] PyO3 binding optimization (numpy integration, async support)

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Create C API examples and documentation
- [ ] Add pkg-config integration for C API
- [ ] Comparative benchmarks against other encoding libraries
- [ ] CPU cache efficiency analysis
- [ ] Create language bindings (Node.js via N-API, Go via cgo)

## Low Priority
- [ ] WebAssembly compilation target
- [ ] Custom memory allocators support
- [ ] Compile-time feature flags for size optimization
